# TestingFactoryIO

This repository is meant for storing Python code that uses the Snap7 Python wrapper in order to communicate with a Siemens S7-1500 PLC and test the effects of memory altering attacks within a realistic factory sim software such as Factory IO.

There are some files for flipping bits, writing single bits, writing to Inputs/outputs/memory area within the PLC, altering Boolean, Int, Float and DInt values.
